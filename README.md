# Medical-Simulator-XROS
A Medical Simulator Problem statement for XROS


**‚¶Å About the Project **

Medical simulators are important tools for training and education in the 
healthcare field because they provide a safe and controlled 
environment for learners to practice and develop their skills. They also 
allow learners to make mistakes and learn from them without causing 
harm to real patients.Medical simulators can be used to teach a wide 
range of medical procedures, including basic life support, advanced 
cardiac life support, and other emergency care procedures. They can 
also be used to teach surgical procedures, such as laparoscopic 
surgery, or to teach medical students how to perform physical exams 
and diagnose patients. The Problem is to create a specific medical 
simulator of your choice
